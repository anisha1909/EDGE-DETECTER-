# EDGE-DETECTER-
### Edge Detector: Description

An **edge detector** is a digital circuit used to detect transitions in a signal, identifying changes such as rising edges (LOW to HIGH), falling edges (HIGH to LOW), or both. It works by comparing the current and previous states of a signal to identify the desired transition.

---

### Key Types:
1. **Rising Edge Detector**: Detects LOW-to-HIGH transitions.
2. **Falling Edge Detector**: Detects HIGH-to-LOW transitions.
3. **Dual-Edge Detector**: Detects both transitions.

---

### Implementation:
- Uses flip-flops to store the previous state of the signal.
- Combinational logic (AND/OR gates) determines if an edge has occurred based on the current and previous states.

---

### Applications:
- Synchronizing asynchronous signals.
- Generating trigger pulses.
- Event detection in digital systems.
